Last week I discovered the [Elm programming language](http://elm-lang.org/). It's a functional language that compiles to HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and it seems pretty nice for creating browser-based games, among other things. I decided to use it to create a simple role-playing game called [Ode](https://github.com/williewheeler/ode).

This is the first in a series of posts that explains&mdash;in tutorial fashion&mdash;how I did it. I'll assume that you've already [installed Elm](http://elm-lang.org/Install.elm) and goofed around with some of the [examples](https://github.com/evancz/elm-examples).

# Set up the project skeleton

Here's the layout:

~~~ plain_text
ode
|_Main.elm
|_elm-package.json
|_resources/
|_src/
~~~

`Main.elm` is an empty file for now. It will be the entry point for our app. This isn't the required filename or anything like that; it's just what I chose.

`src` and `resources` are empty directories for the moment. They are for source code and web resources (e.g., images), respectively. Again, these are just names that I chose, rather than being required.

`elm-package.json` is where we set up our project dependencies, more or less along the lines of a Ruby `Gemfile`, Node `package.json`, etc.:

~~~ javascript
{
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "summary": "Tile-based RPG.",
  "repository": "https://github.com/williewheeler/ode.git",
  "license": "MIT",
  "source-directories": [ "src" ],
  "exposed-modules": [],
  "dependencies": {
    "elm-lang/core": "1.1.0 <= v < 2.0.0",
    "evancz/elm-markdown": "1.0.0 <= v < 2.0.0"
  }
}
~~~

After you create your `elm-package.json`, run

~~~ shell
$ elm-package install
~~~

to grab your dependencies, which will appear in a directory called `elm-stuff`. Again this is analogous to running `bundle install` in Ruby or `npm install` in Node.

If you like, you can create a `.gitignore` file and add `elm-stuff` to that.

OK, that's our skeleton. Now let's get some game tiles.

# Download a tileset

I grabbed the [Planet Cute tileset](http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html) by [Daniel Cook](https://twitter.com/danctheduck). For this tutorial you probably want the same thing just because the tile rendering code depends on specific characteristics of this tileset.

Put the tileset in the `resources` directory:

~~~ plain_text
ode
|_resources
  |_planet-cute
    |_Brown Block.png
    |_Character Boy.png
    |_etc.
~~~

That concludes our setup. We're ready for some actual Elm coding.

# Render a basic map

~~~ haskell
module Ode.Main where

import Graphics.Element (..)

main = ...
~~~
